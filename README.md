Why did chicken cross the road?

## Table of contents

* Pygame
    - lab1 Simple live capture with thresholding - (16.11.17)
    - lab2 First implementation of pixel-by-pixel filtering, with some debugging to be done - (23.11.17)
    - lab3 
        - Implementation of Canny edge detection algorithm (7.12.17)
        - Debugging, tuning for better performance (14.12.17)
    - lab4 Benchmarking implemented methods (14.12.17)
* OpenCV 
    

## Requirements
Following Python 3 modules are required:

* Pygame
* cython

## Setup
If files in lab* directory require any building/compilation use `python3 build.py` and `python3 clean.py` to build and clean the directory accordingly.
